          <b>Beat the eggs:</b> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt
          and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of
          water or milk for a fluffier texture.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2 pl-[16px]">
          <b>Heat the pan:</b> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and
          add butter or oil.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2 pl-[16px]">
          <b>Cook the omelette:</b> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour
          in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2 pl-[16px]">
          <b>Add fillings (optional):</b> When the eggs begin to set at the
          edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen
          fillings over one half of the omelette.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2 pl-[16px]">
          <b>Fold and serve:</b> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully
          lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another
          minute, then slide it onto a plate.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2 pl-[16px]">
          <b>Enjoy:</b> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
